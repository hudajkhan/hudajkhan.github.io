<h2> Linked Data for Production: Closing the Loop </h2>
<div> In this grant, we continued generating targeted experiments to explore how we could integrate linked data into the catalog.  We also worked on integrating some of our previous work into the catalog.  As part of the former, I designed and conducted user testing, sometimes in collaboration and other times as the lead facilitator.  As part of the latter, I helped facilitate discussions with our user representatives group to identify which features could be integrated into production. </div>

<h2> Linked Data for Production: Pathways to Implementation </h2>
<div> In this grant, we brainstormed multiple ideas for targeted experiments for integrating linked data into Blacklight catalogs.  As part of each of our work phases, I contributed to user and usability testing by designing and carrying out usability testing on mockups or the prototype, contributed to collaborative user testing and research, and helped facilitate a focus group of librarians and staff to get feedback on our various experiments. </div>

<h2> FOLIO (Future of Libraries is Open </h2>
<div> I helped coordinate the definition of user tasks to be provided to the Cornell Usability Working Group on behalf of various stakeholders.  As part of this work, I also participated in the FOLIO Accessibility SIG and included reports from Cornell usability <a href="https://wiki.folio.org/display/A11Y/Accessibility+Reports+and+Resources">here</a>. </div>

<h2> Linked Data for Libraries-Labs </h2>
<div> Building on user research conducted by other colleagues, I conducted multiple interviews to better understand how catalogers approached cataloging.  In the process of working on VitroLib, a linked data cataloging prototype built on top of the existing semantic ontology editor Vitro, I designed protocols for and conducted usability testing with catalogers.  Overview of this work is available <a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/ld4lLABS/Lessons+Learned%3A+VitroLib+User+Feedback+and+Usability+Review">here</a>.  </div>

<h2> Usability Group </h2>
<div> From 2010 through 2012, I participated in (what was then called) the Usability Group. This group supported various Cornell Library usability efforts, including defining which kind of usability testing protocol to use, helping stakeholders define tasks, and conducting user testing. </div>
