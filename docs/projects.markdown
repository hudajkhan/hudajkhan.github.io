<h2> Cornell University / Research Application Programmer </h2>
<h3>JANUARY 2010 - PRESENT,  ITHACA, NY</h3>

<h4> Linked Data for Production: Pathways to Implementation (LD4P2) and Linked Data for Production: Closing the Loop (LD4P3)</h4>
<div> Collaborated with cross-institutional partners to design, implement, and evaluate various experimental prototypes demonstrating the integration of linked data in discovery environments.   Extended and customized a copy of the Cornell Blacklight catalog to incorporate additional information using Ruby on Rails and  jQuery.  Set up and updated Solr indices as needed for aggregating, caching, and/or adding cross-references between entities.  Conducted analysis of data sources using a combination of querying, indexing, and downloading linked data sources.  Collaborated with Stanford for design and user testing experimental prototypes.  Facilitated a collaborative brainstorming  group focused on grant discovery work.   
LD4P3: Helped coordinate meetings with catalog user representatives to define features from prototypes that could be used in the production catalog.   
LD4P2: Managed a team with two other developers to implement discovery solutions using external data.

<h4> Future of Libraries is Open (FOLIO): Coordinated user testing for various FOLIO apps and modules.</h4>
<div> Facilitated discussion with various stakeholders responsible for different workflows (e.g. Circulation/Access, Metadata management, Resource management, ERM) to identify tasks for user testing.  Coordinated discussion for introducing and refining tasks  with Usability Working Group who carried out user testing. </div>

<h4>Linked Data for Libraries-Labs</h4>
<div> Part of team developing VitroLib, a linked data cataloging editor, which extended underlying Vitro architecture to represent bibliographic information.  Conducted user interviews and usability testing to better understand cataloger needs.  </div>

<h4>NY Climate Change Science Clearinghouse</h4>
<div> Developer on  (New York State Energy and Research Development Authority) NYSERDA project.   Using JAVA, implemented customizations to VIVO and its underlying search index to enable modeling and querying using a custom climate change concepts ontology.  Created a Ruby gem for porting VIVO application display for properties to a Blacklight discovery front-end for this content.  Integrated SPARQL query results  in Blacklight using Rails caching. </div>


<h4>EarthCollab</h4>
<div> Participated as a developer in this National Science Foundation (NSF) project for representing relationships between scientific resources, people, projects using the EarthCollab ontology and customizations to VIVO.  Implemented proof of concept demonstrating how two separate VIVO instances could show information from each other for linked entities.  Used JAVA to implement mechanism for exporting all displayed information for a VIVO entity as JSON. 
</div>

<h4>Cornell University Geospatial Information Repository (CUGIR)</h4>
<div> Part of team that re-implemented CUGIR to use GeoBlacklight.  Continue to work on upgrades and maintenance.   </div>

<h4>IMLS Datastar project</h4>
<div> Project Coordinator and developer.  Managed  ontology and architecture discussions.   Extended VIVO with custom search and custom display functionality for Datastar.  </div>

<h4> NIH VIVO project</h4>
<div> Developer.  Re-implemented menu and page management, updated RDF editing framework, and integrated external vocabulary service using JAVA, Freemarker, jQuery, and JSP.</div>   

<h4> Data Staging Repository (DataStaR) platform</h4>
<div> Developer. Implemented and improved functionality for submitting, editing, and sharing research data sets using semantic ontology-based front-end and FEDORA (Flexible Extensible Digital Object Repository Architecture) file storage.</h3>
