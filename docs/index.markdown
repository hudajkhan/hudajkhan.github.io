<h1>Summary</h1>
<div class="ml-2">I'm a full-stack software engineer with 14 years of professional experience with various front-end and back-end technologies and frameworks.  I also have substantial experience with conducting, interpreting, and applying user research.  I am well-versed with semantic technologies and discovery environments like Blacklight. </div>

<div>I have worked in software development at Cornell University since 2010. I am interested in the design and architecture of linked data and semantic web applications, specifically in: (a) supporting usability through effective interface design and (b) enabling flexible interplay between different components and/or technologies. I have participated in the following linked data related projects: Datastar, VIVO, EarthCollab, the Linked Data For Libraries Labs grant, and Linked Data for Production: Pathways to Implementation.  I currently help with the direction of the discovery area of the Linked Data for Production: Closing the Loop grant.</div>

<div> I have contributed to diffrent projects that employ Blacklight and GeoBlacklight. I am a developer on the Cornell University Geospatial Information Repository (CUGIR) project. </div>

<div>I have a joint Ph.D. in Computer Science and Cognitive Science from the University of Colorado at Boulder.</div>

<div>The "Projects" page lists more information about various projects to which I've contributed.  "Outputs" lists select publications and presentations. "User research" reviews user research and usability testing efforts.</div>
